# Masterarbeit: Hierarchical Image Classification of Lung Nodules  

This repository contains the implementation of the **Hierarchical Image Classification of Lung Nodules** as part of a master's thesis. The project focuses on developing and evaluating a hierarchical deep learning framework to classify lung nodules in CT images.  

## üìå Project Overview  

Lung nodule classification is a crucial step in the early detection of lung cancer. This work aims to improve classification performance using a **hierarchical classification approach**, considering multiple classification levels. The dataset used includes **LIDC-IDRI** and **Lung-PET-CT-Dx**.  

### üîπ Features  
- **Hierarchical image classification** of lung nodules  
- **Deep learning models** (CNNs, 3D CNNs) for feature extraction and classification  
- **Handling imbalanced data** through undersampling and other techniques  
- **Evaluation metrics** for performance assessment  

## üóÇ Dataset  

The experiments utilize:  
- **[LIDC-IDRI](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/lidc-idri/)**: A well-known dataset containing annotated lung nodules from CT scans.  
- **[Lung-PET-CT-Dx](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/lung-pet-ct-dx/)**: Another dataset incorporated for enhanced classification performance.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The datasets are not included in this repository due to size constraints. Please refer to their official sources for access.  

## üì¶ Installation
